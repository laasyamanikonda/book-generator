--previous weeks--


monday:
- applied mentor guidance and watched freeCodeCamp videos + reviewed openAI API docs
  - also joined more competitions - app/web development in order to build more personal projects (as recommended by Srikar)
  
tuesday:
- tried to use school macs to apply learning knowledge, but there were too many errors
  - troubleshot these errors and tried to set up project--didn't work so decided to do it on personal laptop :(
- emailed aspen elementary principal to see if theyd be interested in using the app/website eventually (no one responded yet... :( )
                                                                                                        
wednesday:
- updated HTML code to unify theme
- change theme color(s) bc they were ugly (yay)
- mapped out that i wanted to use the app/website for kids and not as a general generator, but i may make a separate project altogether that 
incorporates the generator code as well?
                                                                                                        
thursday n friday: 
i was doing GWC and cs club stuff...sorry :(

sunday (make-up 4 thursday and friday):
  -created project using node.js (yay) and synced to github + made new project and stuff
  - created js file for generator, incorporated API key and code to generate similar titles based on an input title or genre
  -debugged js file because of runtime(?) errors but i didn't fix it
  takeaway: i think i need to pay for the advanced API key because it said there were too many requests to process, resulting in a 429 error!
